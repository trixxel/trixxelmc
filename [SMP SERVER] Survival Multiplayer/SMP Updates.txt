# Patch Notes – Bug Fix & Balance Updates

1. Quest NPCs now provide access to **all quest steps** within a questline.  
   Players who previously quit or abandoned quests can now re-engage without being progression locked.

2. Rebalanced **Mob Crate drop tables** to reduce the frequency of high-tier items.  
   With Mob Crate key drops slightly nerfed, reward weights have been adjusted to maintain balance without making crates feel unrewarding.

3. Updated **Master Weapon Crates** to use **10-level bracketed variants**.  
   This prevents players from receiving unusable weapons and better aligns crate rewards with MMOCore’s progression system.

4. Fixed an issue where mobs could drop **multiple crate keys** (e.g., common and rare) from a single kill.  
   Drop table arguments now correctly restrict key drops to one per mob.

5. Fixed an issue where **skill and attribute points** were dropping far more frequently than intended.  
   Drop rates are now correctly aligned with expected values.

6. Fixed an issue where players were **unable to build in purchased shops**.  
   WorldGuard region priority was corrected and regions were recreated to restore proper build permissions.


# Reported Issues

1. Random item duplication when dying or reconnecting to the server. [R]

2. **Bad Chat Token**  
   Players may encounter an error where they are unable to communicate in chat.  
   This appears to be caused by a temporary disruption between the player’s network and the Trixxel network, resulting in an invalid or broken chat token. [R]
